                    <p>2.2 Deal Value will be calculated as follows:</p>

                        <li>If the agreement between the Operator and the client includes a lock-in period, the Deal Value is monthly rental × number of months in the lock-in period.</li>
                        <li>If there is no lock-in period, the Deal Value will be calculated based on the tenure of the agreement (monthly rental × number of months).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>2.3 Renewal Commission: In the event the Operator and the client renew their agreement, the Platform will charge a commission of 10% of the deal value for the renewal period calculated in the same manner as the initial commission.</p>

                    <p>4.1 If the Operator wishes to list their coworking space as a Featured Space, the Operator agrees to pay a monthly fee as determined by the Platform.</p>
